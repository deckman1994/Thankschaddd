////// My Uml and my class of employee will make specfic changes and retreive specific information of employees. It will have clock in times, clock out times, and certain information for documentation.

////// I believe that I will run into huge problems with my idea of manager roles and employee roles of retrieving files.
//I also believe that a problem I will run into is figuring out how to organize the employees and the specific inform into a vector. I understand classes and how to retreieve information but organizing the employees into a vector and staying orgnaized will be hard.
