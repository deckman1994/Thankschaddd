# Thankschaddd

Ok. So this project has been killing me. Do you understand it?
I basiccly have a manager doing things to the employee. But all saving it to a vector "database"

I dont understand vectors and how they save to a file and then how they output. If you can help me with a the green comment and how they work together. 

I do understand the fucntions and the employee.getsstatus And what that does. 
If you could do like one of the fucntions i have commented I will slowly but surely start understanding. I just need a helpful push. :)
